# Vodica

Welcome to the repository for the Vodica project! 

## Technologies Used

- **Gulp**: Used for automating tasks like CSS minifying, JavaScript transpilation, and more, ensuring a streamlined development process.
- **Webpack**: Utilized for bundling JavaScript files, managing dependencies, and optimizing the build process.
- **JavaScript**: The core programming language used for implementing interactive features and client-side logic.

## Features

Project includes several key features that enhance user interaction and data handling:

- **Calculator**: A dynamic calculator for user inputs and computations.
- **Cards**: Dynamically generated cards that display information fetched from a server via JSON.

- **Mobile Menu**: A responsive and interactive menu optimized for mobile devices.

## Future Enhancements

- **Shopping Cart**: Plans are underway to integrate a shopping cart feature that will allow users to select and manage products before making a purchase.

## Modular Code Structure

The project is structured into modular blocks that separate concerns and functionalities, making the codebase easier to manage and scale. This approach enhances readability and maintainability, allowing new features to be added seamlessly without affecting existing functionalities.
